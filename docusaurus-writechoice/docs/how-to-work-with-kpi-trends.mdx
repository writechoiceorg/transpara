2. **Legend**: All existing lines on the graph are identified on the legend. Click on a legend item to toggle its visibility.

3. **Time Range Control**: It displays the current time range. In addition, it provides buttons to navigate to older or new time intervals. You can modify the time range of the KPI view using the **Time Ranges** functionality.

4. **Functionalities**: KPI trends visualization provides several configurations to change how you analyze the KPI data. Check the [Features of the KPI Panel](#features-of-the-kpi-panel) to learn about the available options.

5. **Interaction tools**: These tools enable you to interact with the graph. For further information, check the [Interaction tools](#interaction-tools).
