At the core of Visual KPI is its ability to effortlessly integrate with your existing operations. Visual KPI's flexibility is one of its defining features. In addition to supporting thousands of data sources, it provides customizable deployment options and security functionalities to cover all industries and businesses.

## Where Virtual KPI Software Lives

Many new users assume that Visual KPI software operates in the cloud, such as a SaaS, and that customer data will be hosted externally. However, this is not the case.

First, Visual KPI doesn't require moving any data to new databases. It reads your data in near-real-time from wherever you keep it and uses it without requiring you to manage and maintain a new master data source.

Regarding the Visual KPI deployment, you can choose the option that best suits your business needs. You can integrate Visual KPI software inside your environment using one of the following options:

- **In Your Cloud**: Visual KPI can be hosted in your cloud environment, providing the convenience of cloud-based deployment.

- **On Your Server**: Alternatively, you can run Visual KPI on your server, giving you complete control over your operations and ensuring the data will stay within your organization.

Transpara understands that each customer and each application may require a different deployment approach, and we are open to customizing it and aligning it to your unique needs.

## Security Integration

Visual KPI efficiently integrates with your existing security model. Transpara understands that only you thoroughly understand your security requirements, making it completely customizable at all levels. When using Visual KPI, you can:

- Set up permissions for your Visual KPI websites to limit who can view your KPI data.
- Create local groups and users to specify who can access each KPI collection.
- Use object-level security to restrict access to specific objects within Visual KPI, such as KPIs, Charts, Tables, or Groups.
- Define permissions for the Visual KPI Designer to limit who can modify your KPI configurations.

Transpara`s Visual KPI is a Web server-based application. As a result, it takes advantage of existing authentication and rights-assignment subsystems within the platform, including the directory and all related security policies. In addition, the Visual KPI makes sharing real-time information easy and secure. It shares links rather than data, ensuring that sensitive information doesn't fall into the wrong hands.

To learn more about security in Visual KPI, access the [Securitiy](/access-level) page on the documentation or the [security articles list](https://www.transpara.com/article-categories/security/) on the knowledge base.
