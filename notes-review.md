- trend is a solution, not a tool. Should be singular.
- We should not reference to buniness
- When defining siglas, we should use captilize first letter
- Use Transpara systen instead of Trasnpara products
- is it an example of sarcasm? allowing you to visualize data in an obvious way (via status, color and alerting) 
- SPC are charts
- multiple-pen
- avoid rea-time, use near real-time
- Use a more generalist approach. Instead of "This page" use "on every page" when presenting general exampels.
- Use live data when refers to graph data
- should not use contraction with it -> avoid it'll -> use it will
- Use See instead of Check
- Use trend options instead of functonalities.
- Use trend gestures instead of interaction tools.
- Always describe each existing option. For example, if a selector provides 5 different options, we should describe the result of selecting each one, even if the result is obvious.
- Use default instead of original
- try to present the reason or how users can use the features:

  - instead of: Visualize KPI performance compared to reference values, if available. In the example below, when the **Status Background** is activated, you can easily see times when the **Actual** value (blue) surpasses the **High Limit** (red).

  - Use: Visualize KPI performance compared to reference values, if available. In the example below, when the **Status Background** is activated, you can easily see times when the **Actual** value (blue) surpasses the **High Limit** (red). This is an obvious way to see when a KPI is acting erratically or knowing where to zoom in without having to read the data in detail.

- be more descriptive:

  - instead of: Select an area to zoom in.
  - Use: Select an rectangular area to zoom in, which zooms both x and y axes.

- Instead of instances or date points, use points in time
