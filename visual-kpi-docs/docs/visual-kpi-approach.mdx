Here, it is important to highlight how Visual KPI solves the problem and differs from other solutions like PowerBI. In PowerBI, you create a chart and then link data to it. This process needs to be repeated for each new chart. However, with Visual KPI, you define your areas of interest. Once you define the KPIs to be monitored, you can access various ways of automatically visualizing the data. This means you can easily change the visualization method, as all visualization options are readily available.
